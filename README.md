# BINARY SEARCH TREE

A binary search tree is a binary tree where the nodes are arranged in a specific order
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree
A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree in which the left and right subtree are always binary search trees
